    <article class="message">
      <div class="message-body">
        Albums are a simple way of sorting/categorizing uploads together.<br>
        You can share public links to these albums, allowing everyone else to view pretty listings of the uploads in them.<br>
        Albums can also be downloaded as ZIP-archives.<br>
        Both of these features can be toggled per-album basis from the Dashboard.

        Please disregard the names of some of the extensions, this is the only easiest file host solution I can use.
        <br>
        There are some some browser extensions to assist uploads:<br>
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lolisafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox extension</a>. Its GitHub repository is located <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/loli-safe-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>
        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loli-safe-uploader/enkkmplljfjppcdaancckgilmgoiofnj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome extension</a>. Its GitHub repository is located <a href="https://github.com/WeebDev/loli-safe-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>
        With the Chrome extension specifically, you will have to manually set the domain in the extension's settings to <code>https://safe.fleepy.tv</code>.<br>
        <br>
        If you use Windows desktop, the safe support uploads from <a href="https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShareX</a>.<br>
        You can download the config file by clicking on the ShareX icon on the homepage.<br>
        When logged in, the config file will also be automatically populated with your account's token.<br>
        This will allow you to manage your ShareX uploads from our Dashboard.<br>
        <br>
        If you use Linux desktop, there is a compatible bash uploader which I also maintain.<br>
        You can learn more about it from <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/uguush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its GitHub repository</a>.

    <h3 class="subtitle has-text-white-ter">Why is the maximum file size in the No-JS uploader form smaller?</h3>
    <article class="message">
      <div class="message-body">
        This site is using Cloudflare, which limits the maximum upload size.<br>
        Since the homepage uploader chunks your uploads through JS wizardry, it is possible to increase the maximum file size there.

    {% if chunkSizeInt -%}
    <h3 class="subtitle has-text-white-ter">So your API supports chunked uploads?</h3>
    <article class="message">
      <div class="message-body">
        <strong>Yes.</strong> The homepage uploader was coded to chunk uploads into {{ chunkSizeInt }} MB pieces by default. However, this is configurable through its Config tab.<br>
        <br>
        If you want to chunk your API uploads, feel free to inspect the source code to see how it works.<br>
        A rough description of how it works is to simply upload the chunks with their UUID information attached,<br>
        and then call the "finish chunks" API with the said UUID, to rebuild them into a single proper file.

        For now, you will also have to contact me through my email above.<br>
        A feature to delete your own account by yourself is still <strong>work in progress</strong>.<br>
        Otherwise, if you do not mind a record of your username being left here, it should be easy to bulk delete all your uploads from the Dashboard anyway.

        After all, not even an email address is required to register an account.<br>
        Anything will do as your usernames, and passwords are also encrypted.<br>

        <strong>Security purposes.</strong><br>
        For instance, if it is necessary to purge uploads from a specific IP address due to abuse, it <i>will</i> help a lot to be able to find all uploads by that specific uploader.<br>

      <div class="message-body">
        <strong>Yes.</strong><br>
        The logs contain each visitor's IP address.<br>
        This is required by our automated system, that checks logs in real time to detect and punish abuse, such as DDoS attempts, scanners, and so on.<br>
        Logs are rotated daily, and the server will only keep the last 10 logs.<br>
        So you can be assured that the logs will only be kept for <strong>10 days at most</strong>.
